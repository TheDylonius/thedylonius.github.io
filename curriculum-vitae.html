			<div class="job">
				<h3>Technical Lead | Spectrum Digital</h3>
				<p>
					Nov 2023 - Present
				</p>
				<p>
					In my current role as Technical Lead, I act as the central point of contact for all technical matters within the business. I support everything from pre-sales planning through to project delivery, closeout, and ongoing support. I'm still hands-on with development, particularly on high-value or technically complex projects, where success is business-critical.
				</p>

				<p>
					Beyond writing code, I provide guidance to our Automation Engineers, helping them build confidence and autonomy in their own development work. I play an active role in mentoring and upskilling the team, supporting them in writing cleaner, more robust solutions.
				</p>

				<p>
					I'm also responsible for evaluating new implementation tools before their adoption by testing them in real-world scenarios, assessing technical fit, and delivering training to support their introduction. I continue to support our internal development efforts and ensure that technical best practices are upheld across our scrum teams.

				<h3>Automation Engineer | Spectrum Digital</h3>
				<p>
					Dec 2020 - Nov 2023
				</p>
				<p>
					As an Automation Engineer, I was introduced to the internal codebase hosting small applications and class libraries which extended the capabilities of the implementation tools we worked with, including integrations into new Entity Resource Planning (ERP) systems. My primary technologies included C#, JavaScript, and development tools such as Visual Studio and Azure DevOps.
				</p>

				<p>
					I worked on extending the functionality of our internal applications, as well as enhancing the performance and scalability of the codebase. Within this role, I also delivered some small utilities which assisted the Automation Team in delivering solutions, reducing the time to deliver projects but also offering insight into key areas of focus for the projects. I also continued my role in delivering new automation solutions using the below mentioned implementation tools, but with the addition of ABBYY FlexiCapture, further streamlining mundane manual processes and reducing manual intervention.

				<h3>Implementation Apprentice | Spectrum Digital</h3>
				<p>
					Oct 2019 - Dec 2020
				</p>
				<p>
					My journey at Spectrum Digital began as an Implementation Apprentice, where I gained essential hands-on experience in solution implementation and stakeholder communication. I learned to design and implement solutions based on business needs, using tools like JIRA for project management and working with various implementation tools such as Therefore™ (Document Management System - DMS), IRISXtract™ (Optical Character Recognition - OCR), and Qlik (Business Intelligence - BI). I joined as an apprentice to prove I had what it takes to become a full Automation Engineer.

				<h3>Food Service Worker | Domino's</h3>
				<p>
					Oct 2018 - Dec 2019
				</p>
				<p>
					At Domino’s, I honed my time management and problem-solving skills in a fast-paced environment. This experience taught me to prioritize tasks under pressure and work as part of a team. I mainly joined Domino's to generate some income while I was in college to pay for transport and lunch. Anything extra I saved/used to purchase upgrades for my computer and home setup which I was using to further my coding ability and play games.

			<h3>Computing and Digital Technology | Hull College</h3>
			<p>
				Sep 2017 - Sep 2019
			</p>
			<p>
				Achieved a grade of D*D (Distinction Star Distinction) in a 2-year computing course at Hull College. This course covered a wide range of topics from interpersonal and communication skills to event driven and object-oriented programming. There were also topics on game design, web design, and database design. I also completed a project on creating a game using C# and Unity, which was a great introduction to programming and game development.
