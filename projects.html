		<section id="database-completeness-checker">
			<h2>Database Completeness Checker</h2>
			<p>
				This utility is designed to check the completeness of database tables. It helps ensure that sufficient data is present and correctly formatted for the success of a project, reducing errors and increasing success automation projects. The main barrier for a successful automation project is nearly always clean and consistent data.
			</p>

		<section id="assistive-matching">
			<h2>Assistive Matching</h2>
			<p>
				This class library is available as a DLL for various capture tools (IRISXtract, ABBYY FlexiCapture), as well as a REST API for use with other applications. It provides an extremely sophisticated set of rules for normalising invoice and order/receipt data, and matching these two datasets together using various modes.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="document-separation">
			<h2>Document Separation</h2>
			<p>
				This class library is available as a DLL for ABBYY FlexiCapture. It's a very small class library that allows the user to separate documents based on a set of rules. It can be used to split documents into multiple files, or to combine multiple files into a single document.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="cloud-workflow-host">
			<h2>Cloud Workflow Host</h2>
			<p>
				This application sits on local servers and allows the user to configure and extend Therefore™ workflows in the cloud. It is designed to be a simple, easy-to-use interface for implementation specialists who want to extend workflow functionality without having to create publicly accessible APIs within local infrastructure.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="sql-to-master-data">
			<h2>SQL To Master Data</h2>
			<p>
				This utility is designed to read data from a SQL database and create flat files of result sets. It allows the user to configure connection strings, commands, delimiters, qualifiers, headers, and methods. As of right now, it can export CSV and XML representations of results to either the local file system or an SFTP server.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="master-data-to-sql">
			<h2>Master Data to SQL</h2>
			<p>
				This utility is designed to read data from a flat file and create relevant SQL tables with records. It allows the user to configure connection strings, input files, and table names. As of right now, it can import XML files.
			</p>
		</section>

		<section id="integration-projects">
			<h2>Integration Projects</h2>
			<p>
				As an integration specialist, I have worked on various projects that involve integrating different systems and applications. This includes working with APIs, databases, and other technologies to ensure seamless communication and data exchange between systems.
			</p>

			<h3>Sage200 - Invoices, Credit Notes, Sales Orders, and Projects</h3>
			<p>
				This class library reads information from Therefore™ and creates the relevant document(s) within Sage200. It uses the Sage200 API to create invoices, credit notes, sales orders, and projects, and the Therefore™ API to read data from Therefore™.
			</p>

			<h3>Infor Syteline - Invoices and Credit Notes</h3>
			<p>
				This class library reads information from Therefore™ and creates the relevant document(s) within Infor Syteline. It uses local staging tables for storing and Syteline IDOs to create invoices and credit notes from the staging data. The Therefore™ API is used to write data from into the staging tables for processing.
			</p>

			<h3>Microsoft GP - Invoices and Credit Notes</h3>
			<p>
				This set of SQL stored procedures reads information from Therefore™ and creates the relevant document(s) within Microsoft GP. It uses pre-built stored procedures within Microsoft GP to create invoices and credit notes, and dynamically reads data from a Therefore™ database to get transactional information.
			</p>

			<h3>Microsoft Exchequer - Invoices and Credit Notes</h3>
			<p>
				This class library reads information from Therefore™ and creates the relevant document(s) within Microsoft Exchequer. It uses the Exchequer Enterprise Toolkit API to create invoices and credit notes, and the Therefore™ API to read data from Therefore™.
			</p>

			<h3>Xero - Invoices</h3>
			<p>
				This class library reads information from Therefore™ and creates the relevant document(s) within Xero. It uses the Xero API to create invoices, and the Therefore™ API to read data from Therefore™.
