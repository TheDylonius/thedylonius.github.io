				<p>Hello and welcome to the landing page for my personal website! I will use this space to talk a little
					about myself and share my ideas / work. I'll start with an introduction. My name is Dylan and I'm
					enthused by the world of programming and software development, as I have been since I was a kid.
					I started by making batch scripts trying to re-create games like Zork, as well as little utilities
					which would handle things on my computer automatically for me.
					<br><br>
					Since then, this enthusiasm has followed me throughout my education and working career, while still
					keeping things going from a personal perspective and working on myself where I can. Today, I am an
					Automation Engineer at Spectrum, which is an SME situated just outside Hull in my hometown of
					Hessle, England.
					<br><br>
					So that's a little about myself. The rest of the website will be dedicated to building a portfolio
					of things I've found to be of interest through my career which I would like to share and host
					online. This will grow over time, but understandably, it's quite small at the moment. Stay tuned as
					the website comes to life!
