# thedylonius.github.io
*This website is a WIP (work in progress) between /TheDylonius and /ConHodg.*

## Main Goals
We both fancied working on a development project together and settled on creating a website. We found the easiest medium for hosting a website which we can both easily edit and work with was GitHub Pages.
