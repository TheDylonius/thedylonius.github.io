*This website is a work-in-progress, but it’s now functional and reflective of my personal and professional journey. The design and curriculum vitae (CV) section are already in place and serve as a solid foundation for showcasing my career.*

## Main Goals
This website serves as my personal space on the internet where I can share insights into my personal and professional life. It provides a snapshot of who I am, highlights my skills, and features some of the projects I've worked on over the years.
